## How to use a user group in your Temporal Cloud account {#create-group}

User groups can be used to help manage sets of users that should have the same
access. Instead of assigning the roles to individual users, a user group can be
created, assigned the desired roles, and then users added to the user group. This
eases the toil of managing individual user permissions can simply access management. When
a new role is needed, it can be added to group and all users' access will reflect the
new role.

## How to assign roles to a user group {#assign-group-roles}

Each user group in Temporal Cloud can be assigned roles. The roles are the same as used for users.

- [Account-level roles](/cloud/users#account-level-roles)
- [Namespace-level permissions](/cloud/users#namespace-level-permissions)

Users can be assigned to many groups. In the event that user's group memberships have multiple roles for the same resource, the user will have an effective role of the most permissive of the permissions. For example if a `Group A` grants a read-only role to a namespace, but `Group B` grants a write role to a namespace then a user that belongs to both `Group A` and `Group B` would have the write role to the namespace.

## How SCIM groups work with user groups {#scim-groups}

SCIM groups work similarly to user groups with respect to role assignment. The lifecycle of the SCIM group is managed by the SCIM integration which means:

1. SCIM groups cannot be created except through the SCIM integration
1. SCIM groups cannot be deleted except through the SCIM integration
1. SCIM group membership is managed through the SCIM integration

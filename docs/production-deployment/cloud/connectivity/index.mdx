## What are connectivity rules?

Connectivity rules are Temporal Cloud's mechanism for limiting network access to a namespace.

By default, a namespace has zero connectivity rules, and is accessible from the public internet. When you add connectivity rules, Temporal Cloud will immediately block all traffic that does not have a corresponding connectivity rule from accessing the namespace. One namespace can have multiple connectivity rules, and may mix both public and private rules.

A connectivity rule specifies public (i.e. internet) or private (i.e. [AWS PrivateLink](/aws-connectivity) or [Google Cloud Private Service Connect](/gcp-connectivity)) access to a namespace. See the linked docs to learn more about setting up those private connections in your cloud provider and configuring DNS for your workers.

Namespace access is always securely authenticated via [API keys](/cloud/api-keys#overview) or [mTLS](/cloud/certificates), regardless of connectivity rules.

Only [Account Admins and Account Owners](/cloud/users#account-level-roles) can create and manage connectivity rules.

## Creating a connectivity rule

Connectivity rules can be created and managed with [tcld](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/) or [Terraform](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-provider-temporalcloud/).

### Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)

Create public connectivity rule:

```bash
tcld connectivity-rule create --connectivity-type public
```

Create private connectivity rule (AWS):

```bash
tcld connectivity-rule create --connectivity-type private --connection-id "conn-123" --region "aws-us-east-1"
```

Create private connectivity rule (GCP):

```bash
tcld connectivity-rule create --connectivity-type private --connection-id "conn-456" --region "gcp-us-central1" --gcp-project-id "my-project-123"
```

The `cr` alias works the same way:

```bash
tcld cr create --connectivity-type public
```

Private connectivity rule:

```bash
tcld cr create --connectivity-type private --connection-id "conn-123" --region "aws-us-east-1"
```

### Terraform

[Example in the Terraform repo](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-provider-temporalcloud/tree/main/examples/resources//temporalcloud_connectivityrule/resource.tf)

## Update connectivity rules on a namespace

Be careful! When any connectivity rules are set on a namespace, that namespace is ONLY accessible via the connections defined in those rules. If you remove a connectivity rule that your workers are using, your traffic will be interrupted.

### Temporal Cloud CLI (tcld)

Setting the connectivity rules on a namespace:

```bash
tcld namespace set-connectivity-rules --namespace "my-namespace" --connectivity-rule-ids "rule-id-1" --connectivity-rule-ids "rule-id-2"
```

Or using aliases:

```bash
tcld n scrs -n "my-namespace" --ids "rule-id-1" --ids "rule-id-2"
```

Remove all connectivity rules:

```bash
tcld namespace set-connectivity-rules --namespace "my-namespace" --remove-all
```

### Terraform

[Example in the Terraform repo](https://github.com/temporalio/terraform-provider-temporalcloud/tree/main/examples/resources/temporalcloud_namespace/resource.tf#L113-L128)
